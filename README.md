<h1>About the Project</h1>

This project is a memory card matching game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. It fetches images of various characters from the "Rick and Morty" TV series using an external API and displays them on the cards for players to match.

The main components of the project are:

    App.js: The root component.

    CardList.js: The component responsible for rendering individual memory cards.

    Board.js: The component responsible for generating the game board with cards.

[API Used!](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

We used the Rick and Morty API to get images of characters from the show. The API provides a wide range of character information, and we utilize it to get character images for the game cards.
